Files for replication of "The Safety Net and Job Loss: How Much Insurance Do Public Programs Provide?" by Chloe N. East and David Simon. 

Updated by Chloe N. East on July 22, 2024

The files needed for replication are divided into the folders: analysis and makedata. The makedata folder reads in Survey of Income and Program Participation data and does the necessary cleaning for the main analysis, done in the analysis folder. 

The data folder contains the file regfinal.dta, which is generated by the .do files in the makedata folder and is used for main analysis done in analysis .do files. Underlying SIPP data used in the makedata folder's .do files is available under data/rawdata. 

In our analysis we use data from Larrimore et al. (2022) and Kuka (2020). For information about these data see:
