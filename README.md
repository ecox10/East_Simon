Files for replication of "The Safety Net and Job Loss: How Much Insurance Do Public Programs Provide?" by Chloe N. East and David Simon. 

Updated by Chloe N. East on August 2, 2024

The files needed for replication are divided into the folders: analysis and makedata. The makedata folder reads in Survey of Income and Program Participation data and does the necessary cleaning for the main analysis, done in the analysis folder. 

Below, we summarize the content of the data folder. 
data/outdata:
  - regfinal.dta: generated by the .do files in the makedata folder and is used for main analysis done in analysis .do files
  - statecodes_all.dta: contains state fips codes and names
  - remainder of this folder is populated by running makedata files 

data/rawdata:  
  - Underlying SIPP data used in the makedata folder's .do files 

data/underreporting: 
  - SIPP Dollar Reporting Rate by Income Centile.csv: dollar UI reporting rates by income centile from 1999-2013 (on a scale of 0 to 1)
  - SIPP Participation Reporting Rate by Income Centile: participation UI reporting rates by income centile from 1999-2013 (on a scale of 0 to 1)
    
In our analysis we use data from Larrimore et al. (2022) and Kuka (2020). For information about these data see:

Replication of our SNAP calculator requires data on snap benefits and deduction by location and household size, which we are unable to include.
